                    Gaspar Noé (born December 27, 1963) is an Argentine-French filmmaker. He is the son of Argentine painter, writer and intellectual Luis Felipe Noé. He has directed five feature films: I Stand Alone (1998), Irréversible (2002), Enter the Void (2009), Love (2015), and Climax (2018).

                    His work has been strongly associated with a series of films defined as the cinéma du corps/cinema of the body, which according to Tim Palmer share an attenuated use of narrative, generally assaulting and often illegible cinematography, confrontational subject material, a treatment of sexual behavior as violent rather than mutually intimate, and a pervasive sense of social nihilism or despair.
