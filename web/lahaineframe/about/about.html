<a href="../index.html"><h1>LA HAINE</h1></a>

<p>
La Haine (French pronunciation: ​[la ʔɛn], Hate) is a 1995 French black-and-white drama film written, co-edited, and directed by Mathieu Kassovitz. It is commonly released under its French title in the English-speaking world, although its U.S. VHS release was titled Hate. It is about three young friends and their struggle to live in the banlieues of Paris. The title derives from a line spoken by one of them, Hubert, "La haine attire la haine!", "hatred breeds hatred."
<br/><br/>
The film depicts approximately 20 consecutive hours in the lives of three friends in their early twenties from immigrant families living in an impoverished multi-ethnic French housing project (a ZUP – zone d'urbanisation prioritaire) in the suburbs of Paris, in the aftermath of a riot.

This website aims to take a viewer through a gallery of what I think are the best stills from the movie and all of which carry some sort of social message or the other. Since the entirety of the movie is shot in high-contrast black and white, I have used the strong backgrounded colours to allude to the moods, temperaments and feelings of the main characters.
