             I really liked this article about primitive web design. I always find this period before the corporate web, where most of it was used for and by academics, to be really interesting. It resonates with me a lot, as I grew up in India, so even though it was the early 2000s, I still remember having dial-up and all the old experiences that came along with it, like making sure nobody picks up the phone when I'm trying to connect and so on. Thus I feel this connection to the primitive web and it is really interesting to see that so many "Prof. Dr"s use this web style, even today. They just update the content, letting the styling and colour schemes remain as they did back in the 90s. They almost serve as time capsules that are constantly updating their content but preserving their appearance. Funnily, I have noticed a trend of retro and brutalist web design by contemporary artists, trying to call back to this time. It was a super interesting read.
