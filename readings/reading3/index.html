                <u>a new Art Object</u> is a term that I never knew I was looking for. I have come across many such Art Objects in the past few years on the web and never had a word to describe them. This reading by Miltos Manetas posed to be a very interesting one for me. Halfway through the reading, the author introduced the term <em>Telic</em> and I began to think that this is another one of those Dieter Rams-esque design principle readings which usher the designer into thinking about functionality. Of course, an object should be functional, I'm not disputing that. But the way a user perceives the function of an object is what matters to. And that's when the author described what a <em>Neen</em> is. And this term encapsulates my view of art perfectly. I wish to make new Art Objects too, because for me, one of the greatest things about any kind of art, be it film, web design or a photo, is the pleasure of interpreting it in my own way. Some of these interpretations just exist in the frame of my mind, and it's not something that I can put into words, it exists more as an emotion. This is the sort of design that I strive toward.
