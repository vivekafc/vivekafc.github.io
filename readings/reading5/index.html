              As somebody who is about to graduate, this article really resonated with me. I have noticed that when I am choosing teachers and wish to view their work online, most of the time the teachers on the elder side tend to not really have a website of their work. Even if they do, it looks very simple, aiming more for functionality than it does to bring out their individuality as artists. However, my younger teachers and peers alike, all have websites that are incredibly unique and speak to how they are as a person. Every single person chooses to present their work in different ways, thus even though they might work in the same mediums (book design, packaging, branding etc.), it is the way that they present their work that alludes to their individuality as artists. I find myself constantly trying to re-do my portfolio, drawing inspiration from different artists whom I've viewed online, collaging and combining, and thus generating my own unique way.
