             Apple's UI/UX design has always been appealing to me. As a child I was always surrounded by Apple products, beginning with the iPod. The thing about this reading that resonated most with me was the concept of <em>Aesthetic Integrity</em>. In my design I have often found myself guilty of trying to strive for a certain aesthetic that I scrolled past the previous week and incorporate that into my design rather than think of whether it added or complemented any of the functionality. Especially for the first project, Interface, I felt like I retrofitted my concept to match my design rather than vice versa, thus this is something I want to work on moving forward as a designer.
