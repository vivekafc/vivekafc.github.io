                I think in the modern day, a lot of our purchasing decisions are definitely influenced by aesthetics and brand value over utility and quality. The opening statements of this reading allude to how we perceive purchasing power in the 21st Century. A lot of our purchases aren't driven as much by need as they are by want. This makes me wonder about the power of branding. There's loads of people who line up to buy the new iPhone annually, even though they can't afford it. They finance it through monthly payments just to have the new phone.
