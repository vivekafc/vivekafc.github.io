             Memes are a huge part of modern society and they definitely help to shape our perception of things. In a previous reading, I wrote about the "Ok, boomer" meme and how that became so widespread. But the reason it gained so much traction, in my opinion, is due to the political climate we're surrounded in. Under the current government, we reside in a very conservative climate, thus people who oppose such a government choose to use memes as a form of retaliation. Not only are they harmless, but they can also gain traction (via retweets, likes, regrams) and maybe help somebody else shape their view.
