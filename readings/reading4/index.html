               The articles on  Material Design by Google really helped me envision websites better. In particular, the article on typography on the web and how we should utilise heirarchy as designers to not only present something that is aesthetic but is also functional. Many a time designers tend to copy/shift toward typographic trends without really paying much thought to whether the type works well with the rest of the website and whether it communicates what its meant to or not. <br><br> All in all, I really appreciated this view of design and it made me ponder about my websites more.
