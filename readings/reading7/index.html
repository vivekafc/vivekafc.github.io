              The term handmade web really piqued my curiosity. Upon reading the article, the handmade web is something that I have been doing since I was a child. For many people from my generation, who had access to computers and the internet growing up, Tumblr was a huge part of our lives. I remember being 13 years old and coming back from school every afternoon, my first priority being logging onto "www.vivekafc.tumblr.com". It was my tumblr blog which comprised information and pictures on everything from anime to my favourite soccer team, Arsenal. I remember changing it bi-weekly to a different theme, even though the content remains the same. And even though I didn't have an inkling of an idea on how to code, I would go into the default themes' code and find words that made sense to me and correlated to the content and tweaked them till it had the desired (or close to) efffect on my website. I think the handmade web played a very important role in my upbringing and interpretation of the internet, thus this article proved to be really interesting to me.
