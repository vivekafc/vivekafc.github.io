                This reading by Laurel Schwulst really got me thinking about the state of the web as we know it. We live in an era where we consume so much inspiration. This in fact serves as a starter point given to many designers by companies who've hired them. Websites are now designed to make the message simple and straight to the point. The user should be able to intuitively understand what the website is trying to convey. As such, I have noticed a parallel rising to this, for lack of a better word, corporate structure of web design. Many young designers and artists nowadays, such as <a href="https://mikey-joyce.tumblr.com/">Mikey Joyce</a> or <a href="http://gunner.film/">Gunner Stahl</a>, curate their work in such a manner that, while it still maintains its goal of delivering a message simply, it manages to create this Dadaist atmosphere, serving as a contrast to the more minimal and simplistic design styles employed by companies like Apple or Google. According to me, we need both of these styles to maintain a balance that allows one to take pleasure in both of them; an overload of either would turn off any user.
