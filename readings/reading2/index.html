                The reading <em>What is Code?</em> really dissects code down to its bare form and explains to the reader the implications of code. It got me thinking about coding and the various uses it has nowadays. There were so many moments in the article that I found relatable. When presented with the interactive keyboard, pressing a letter on the keyboard would result in two outputs. For example, if you pressed A, the output would be "F0, 1C". However, if you continue to hold down A, the output would change, giving you a barrage of "1C"s. Through deductive reasoning, I came to the conclusion that pressing A on the keyboard correlates to two functions: F0 and 1C. F0 is a function that just outputs A once when pressed. On the other hand, 1C is a function which outputs A multiple times, i.e. when it is held down.<br><br>

                As the article progresses, the author discusses how even doing something that seems as minute as coding a key to respond to a particular letter, is such a difficult function to actually write. The programmer has to begin thinking of limitations when they're writing this function. Many actions may repel each other causing the code to break, so it has to be a very specific process. And I related to this aspect, as many times when I'm trying to code something, especially in cases where it must be responsive, as soon as I think I have fixed the problem, another one will pop up. Something as simple as centering elements side-by-side gives me a hassle.
