              Reading this article got me thinking about how my peers and I view images nowadays. In my opinion, the thing we all have in common is this extreme exposure to memes on a daily basis. I can't think of the last time I went a day without seeing a regurgitated or new meme. Memes themselves call for this remix and regurgitation as it provides the user with a template, after which they are free to write their own captions. These memes have much more power than we think they do. For example, this past month, I have witnessed a sudden uprise of "Ok, Boomer" memes. They are tongue-in-cheek and used to reference people of a past generation who don't really have a grasp of modern technology or politics and are stuck in their times. It reached the point where boomers themselves began to retaliate. The website <em>Know Your Meme</em> claims that the exact origin of the phrase is currently unknown. On 4chan, the retort was first used by an anonymous /r9k/ user on September 3rd, 2015. If this is true, then this means that a comment on a thread from close to five years ago is now one of the biggest meme formats in 2019. This is all due to regurgitation of the screenshot which spread around, 4 years later.
