             Upon reading the title of the article, the first thing that sprung to mind was a video I saw as a 10 year old of Steve Ballmer screaming "developers" for close to half a minute. Although it is (extremely) hilarious, after reading this article I understand where his passion is coming from. To build a library of code is not an easy task, every single step of the way has to be accounted for by a huge team of developers. We now have to take into account the ethics of development. A lot of contemporary web/app design and development veers the consumer towards more consumerism rather than utility. There aren't enough websites or apps out there that enable the user to make ethical choices, rather they just feed our addictions. As the new generation of designers, I think it's imperative that we think about what we're designing and WHY we're doing it. Of course money is important but it will soon become the only thing worth pursuing in design the way things are moving. We must incorporate integrity into contemporary branding and interfaces.
