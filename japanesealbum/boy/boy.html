			<h1>A Repatriated Child, August 30, 1946</h1>


			<div class="text">A group of abandon Japanese is generally referred to as the zanryu-hojin (残留邦人). Children are specifically referred to as zanryu-koji.

			<br/><br/>残留孤児 (Zanryū minashigo) meaning abandon war orphans. Most were adopted by poor Chinese peasant families and absorbed into the local population. Some led their lives as ordinary Chinese without knowing their background as adopted children or Japanese orphans until they were told in their forties, fifties, or even sixties 

			<br/><br/>While in the 1950s there were some attempts to repatriate these people, many children were ignorant of their Japanese heritage. Most of the women had children with their new Chinese husbands and could not abandon their offspring and families, which was the price of repatriation.
