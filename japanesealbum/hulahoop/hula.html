			<h1>Hula-Hoop Craze in Japan, October 30, 1958</h1>


			<div class="text">Hula Hoops are popular all over the world, but were once banned in Japan for indecency.

			<br/><br/>Many Japanese felt the key factor in losing the war had not been a difference between the capabilities of the individual Japanese and American soldiers, but rather the superior ability of the American economy to rapidly produce large quantities of war materials. It seemed only natural, then, to use America’s free enterprise system as the model for rebuilding Japan. As it had done twice before in its history, Japan sent some of her finest young people to a foreign country to study its economic, political, social, and educational systems. The knowledge gained from their studies in the United States was then used to restructure Japan’s major institutions while maintaining the essence of the Japanese culture. This desire to assimilate the best that America had to offer resulted in an amazingly high degree of cooperation between General MacArthur’s occupation forces and the Japanese people.
