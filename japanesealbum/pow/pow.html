			<h1>Prison Guards Bow, Ofuna POW Camp, September 3, 1945</h1>


			<div class="text">Former Japanese guards at the Ofuna prison camp, 16 miles from Yokohama, described as one of the worst in the area, bow low in the old polite manner as Luther P. Johnson (foreground), Portland, Me., and John Chapman, Los Angeles, Calif., prisoners until Japan capitulated, carry their bags from the camp to freedom.

			<br/><br/>“At one point, during my brother’s interrogation, he was thirsty and asked his inquisitors for some water. They made him drink is own urine. Several times a day a Japanese Imperial Marine, a big guy, who grew up in Chicago and spoke English would show up. He would beat him on his back and legs with his bamboo club.

			Finally, he was taken out of the holding cell and put in the camp with the rest of the POWs. They fed the prisoners rice soup that was supposed to have some fish heads in it. My brother said it had more maggots than anything else in it. After a while the maggots started tasting pretty good."
