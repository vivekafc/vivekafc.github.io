                    Thebe Neruda Kgositsile (born February 24, 1994), known professionally as Earl Sweatshirt, has been called a "hip-hop prodigy" and in 2011 was branded as "the most exciting rapper to emerge in years, a virtuoso who was just starting to figure out what he could do with words."

                    He is characterized primarily by his voice, which has been classified as a "deep baritone", a dense and highly rhythmic flow and rhyme scheme, and an extensive command of language and poetic device.
