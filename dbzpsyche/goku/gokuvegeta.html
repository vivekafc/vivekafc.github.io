			<p>Given morality’s so called objectivity and position as something that is outside our own being then it should be easily detectable by one of these senses. Alas it is not; morality cannot be seen, heard, touched, tasted or smelled.
			Morality is relative. The question of what is really good and what is really evil can only be answered by the said individual.

			Goku and Vegeta have been fighting for thirty years. They both in love with fighting, and both obsessed with growing stronger. But the prince of all Saiyans is a pile of ego and arrogance while “Kakarot” (Goku) is kind and a bit stupid. Ultimately, it is Goku's strength and sacrifice that inspires a man of pure evil to lead a better life.
