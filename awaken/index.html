                The rain grows louder. Lighting & thunder fill the room. She TOSSES and TURNS in her bed, stuck in an ugly nightmare.
                The lamp in the room begins to flicker different shades of red & green

                The mother looks to the front of the hall and spots her INFANT crying in a CRIB, a pale ray of moonlight, keeping it out of the darkness.
                The mother rushes towards her child instinctively.
                She grabs the baby from the crib and hugs it tighter than she ever has before. She turns around to leave only to find-
                The masked man standing by the large doors of the building. He has a BROKEN WHISKEY BOTTLE in one of his bruised hands.

            <p>

               The mother turns to face him in a state of PARALYSIS. She opens her mouth to scream but no sound emerges.
                He takes off his mask to reveal a tough face with dark brown hair. There’s a small SCAR on his cheek.
                He grabs a pillow from the bed and COVERS the mother’s face, slowly SUFFOCATING her.
                The mother struggles to escape. She finally gains control of her arms and pushes the pillow off her face.

            <p>
                Birds chirping. It’s calm, quiet and sunny. No sign of rain. No sign of intrusion.
                The mother lies in bed, sweating profusely, her side of the bed in disarray. She’s PREGNANT.
                She slowly begins to compose herself from her nightmare.
                She turns over and spots the body next to her stirring awake. He turns over to face her. The scar on his cheek.
                The man from the dream, unmasked. Her husband.
