<p>The WikiBook was a project wherein we were asked to select one of the longest pages on Wikipedia, and using that information, build and design a book around it. It was a great typographical challenge as it forced me to think only with type, no lines or shapes. I chose the the page ‘The War in Donbass’ which relates to the annexation of Donbass, Ukraine by Russia. The theme of the book shows the creeping annexation of the Ukranians by Russia.</p>

<h2><a href="http://input.fontbureau.com">Input</a> was the main font that was employed. I decided to use this font as I thought it elicited feelings of a military journal and that it drew a serious and strong reponse from the reader.</h2>

<h4>As the reader continues, the progression of the annexation is visible through the text. As one moves from one chapter to another, they will notice that the chapter starts from an earlier point on the page, indiciating the insidious annexation.</h4>
