<p>East River Raiders is a creative project I undertook during my first year at Parsons. It is meant to represent New York as a soccer team and I tried to embed the cityâ€™s culture into the club.</p>

<div class="wrapper3"></div>
<h2>These are the celtic knots and patterns that I created to highlight the Irish history in New York City, and to bring it alive in this day and age. The colours aim to allude to the flag of New York, employing a royal blue, deep orange and a hint of white.</h2>

<div class="wrapper4"></div>
<h3>The kits feature a more minimal take on the club. It is embroidered with a more minimal version of the crest to reduce visual noise and follows a unanimous pattern with slight differences in the color scheme.</h3>

<div class="wrapper5"></div>
<h4>As well as developing the look for the club, I focused on creating digital marketing for it as well, coming up with the concept of an app for the East River Raiders. This enables fans to gain access to inside information about the club, purchase tickets, keep up with live scores and watch highlights.</h4>
